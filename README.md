## 🚀 Installation

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** (v18 or higher)
- **MongoDB** (running locally or MongoDB Atlas connection)
- **Git** for version control

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/konetichandrakant/drawit.git
    cd drawit
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

    **Client (Frontend)**
    ```bash
    cd client
    npm install
    ```

    **Server (Backend)**
    ```bash
    cd ../server
    npm install
    ```

3. **Environment Setup**

    Create `.env` files in both `client/` and `server/` directories:

    **Server/.env**
    ```env
    PORT=5000
    SOCKET_PORT=5001
    MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/drawit
    JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key_here
    NODE_ENV=development
    ```

    **Client/.env**
    ```env
    REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
    REACT_APP_SOCKET_URL=http://localhost:5001
    ```

4. **Database Setup**
   - Ensure MongoDB is running locally on `mongodb://localhost:27017`
   - Or update the `MONGODB_URI` in `server/.env` with your MongoDB Atlas connection string

## 🏃‍♂️ Running the Application

### Development Mode

**Start the Backend Server**
```bash
cd server
npm start
```
The server will start on:
- API Server: http://localhost:5000
- Socket.io Server: http://localhost:5001

**Start the Frontend Client** (in a separate terminal)
```bash
cd client
npm start
```
The React app will open at: http://localhost:3000

### Production Build

**Build the Frontend**
```bash
cd client
npm run build
```

**Start Production Server**
```bash
cd server
npm run prod
```

## 🎮 How to Play

1. **Register/Login**: Create an account or sign in to your existing account
2. **Create Room**: Generate a unique room ID and become the room owner
3. **Invite Players**: Share the room ID with friends or wait for join requests
4. **Start Game**: Once players have joined, the room owner can start the game
5. **Draw**: All players receive the same prompt and draw on their canvas
6. **Score**: ML models evaluate your drawing accuracy and speed
7. **Compete**: Watch the live leaderboard and see who wins!
8. **Practice**: Use practice mode to improve your drawing skills

### Game Flow
```
Authentication → Room Creation/Joining → Waiting Phase → Game Start → Drawing Phase → Scoring → Leaderboard → Game End
```

## 🔧 Development Guidelines
